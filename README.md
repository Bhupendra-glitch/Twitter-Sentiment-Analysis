**Problem Statement**

Sentiment analysis of tweets enables companies to capture customer feedback in real time. During product launches, this helps identify whether responses are positive or negative, allowing businesses to take corrective actions, improve user experience, and increase revenue.

**Machine Learning & Data Science**

Our approach applies machine learning to classify tweets. Text data is first analyzed, then processed through deep learning models to predict sentiment. The system learns from features within the text to deliver accurate predictions.


**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

NLP techniques are used to convert raw text into numerical data that models can understand. This ensures tweets are transformed into feature vectors, which can then be used for training and prediction.


**Vectorizers**
To represent text mathematically, vectorizers such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings are applied. These methods help capture the context and frequency of words, providing meaningful input for machine learning models.
